To install (Linux): 

Open up a terminal shell and clone the source:

Run the install script with the target installation directory as an argument (the directory will be created if it does not exist):
	./install-qminesweeper.sh ~/QMineSweeperBuild/

Note that the install-qminesweeper.sh script is a symlink to one of the two build system scripts (install-qminesweeper-cmake.sh and install-qminesweeper-qmake.sh), which invoke their respective build systems. These can be called directly is one is desired over the other.

Coming soon! (Sorry Windows users)
